Amazon Influencer Notepad


#klutch  #prior


Initial Thoughts:

1. Start with the hard stuff first - replace the web form with a blade PHP form that collects the information needed from the user (“man_a, man_b”), no one knows what that is LOL.

2. connect the user to the big 5 ocean personality type test on the site for free (totallly optional, but it will help us get to know you betterl (we can offer some incentives etc)

3. I’ll have that as an API, so you can snag it from the database whenever you need to get it it back,


4. Feed that back into your AI product stuff to improve the review profiles


5. It comes back to me again at the end now that it got the products and the scripts, articles etc. form you, I need to pull the newest products and scripts spreadsheet (I’ll be on the lookout for last row of the table)

6. AI will take the text and generate blog posts through the “BlogPost” model, which will have categories, tags, etc tied back from the products spreadsheet and your affiliate links

7. they will be optimized for SEO

8. Reports, admin dashboard, etc


======================================================
