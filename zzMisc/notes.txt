Consider implementing a recommendation system based on user behavior and product ratings
Your class diagram and database schema look comprehensive and well-structured. The reports you've outlined will provide valuable insights into product performance, user behavior, and overall site metrics.

Remember to document your code thoroughly and maintain clear, consistent coding standards throughout the project. Good luck with the Klutch Products site build!
